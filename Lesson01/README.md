In Lesson 01, we learned how to form hypotheses and generate descriptive statistics that can provide insight into your data. We have implemented five exercises and two activities in this lesson to analyze and get insights of the data. We have used dealerships.csv, heights.csv, and auto_upgrades.csv datasets to perform these exericses and activities. These datasets can be found in the **Datasets** folder of this repository. Here is the link to these datasets: https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/SQL-for-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Datasets
